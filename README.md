# coffee-shop-app
This is an app for an imaginary coffee shop which called Tinky Winky Coffee Shop. It provides users to get information about this coffee shop, to order coffee, to learn latest news about coffee events and to contact when they need.

At first screen it asks for the user’s name. When user enters his/her name and clicks the “CONTINUE” button, it shows a greeting message which includes the user’s name at second screen. There are 2 buttons and a image list at second screen. The user can get all information and order coffee by using this screen.
